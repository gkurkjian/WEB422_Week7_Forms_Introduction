# ðŸ“Œ React Forms with Next.js & React Hook Form  
A comprehensive guide to handling forms in a **Next.js application**, showcasing multiple approaches including controlled components, `useState`, `useEffect`, and `react-hook-form`. This project demonstrates different techniques for managing form state, validation, and user interactions efficiently.  

This project covers various implementations such as basic uncontrolled forms, controlled forms using React state, dynamic form state updates with `useEffect`, and advanced form validation using `react-hook-form`.  

## Features  
- Basic form handling with `useState` and `useEffect`  
- Advanced form handling with `react-hook-form`  
- Form validation using built-in and custom rules  
- Dynamic form state updates using `watch`, `setValue`, and `register`  
- Default values handling via `useEffect` and `react-hook-form`  

## Project Structure  
This project is structured as follows:  

- `1.BasicNameForm.js` â†’ Simple form with event handling.  
- `2.NameFormUseState.js` â†’ Uses `useState` for controlled input.  
- `3.NameFormUseEffect.js` â†’ Dynamically sets a default value using `useEffect`.  
- `4.NameFormHookUseForm.js` â†’ Implements `react-hook-form` for cleaner state management.  
- `5.NameFormHookUseFormUseEffect.js` â†’ Uses `setValue` inside `useEffect` to set default values dynamically.  
- `6.NameFormHookFormDetail.js` â†’ Expands the form with multiple fields and `watch()`.  
- `7.NameFormHookFormValidation.js` â†’ Adds validation using `react-hook-form`.  
- `8.NameFormHookFormValidationMoreAttributes.js` â†’ Extends validation with regex, number rules, and error handling.
